Title: Modeling of Smoking-Related Mortality: A Big-Data Analysis of the NLMS (National Longitudinal Mortality Study) Tobacco-Use Cohort in the U.S.

Rationale: Cigarette smoking remains one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide, driving excess mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and respiratory illnesses. Understanding how smoking duration interacts with demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors to influence mortality risk is essential for developing targeted public health interventions. Large national cohorts, such as the NLMS PUMS(Public Use Microdata Sample) Tobacco-Use Cohort, provide a unique opportunity to examine these associations using modern analytical tools.

Objectives: The primary goal of this project is to characterize and predict mortality risk among smokers while accounting for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Key research questions include:
1.	How does time since smoking initiation relate to 5-year mortality risk?
2.	Which demographic or socioeconomic factors (income, education, race, etc.) modify the smoking–mortality association?
3.	Can we build accurate and interpretable models to predict mortality risk among smokers?
4.	What are the most influential factors in mortality prediction?
